## ❌ Missing Environment Variables

### 1. UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY (CRITICAL)
   - **Required for**: Image search functionality in AI-generated screens
   - **Used in**: `inngest/tool.ts` - `unsplashTool` function
   - **Where to get it**: 
     1. Sign up at https://unsplash.com/developers
     2. Create a new application
     3. Copy your Access Key
   - **Add to `.env`**:
     ```
     UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here
     ```

### 2. INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY (REQUIRED for Production)
   - **Required for**: Verifying Inngest webhook requests in production
   - **Used by**: Inngest webhook endpoint (`/api/inngest`)
   - **Where to get it**: 
     1. Sign up at https://www.inngest.com (free account)
     2. Create an app in the dashboard
     3. Go to Settings → Keys
     4. Copy the Signing Key
   - **Add to `.env` (production only)**:
     ```
     INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=signkey_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
     ```
   - **Note**: Not needed in development mode (uses local dev server)

### 3. NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (REQUIRED for Production)
   - **Required for**: Inngest to know where your app is deployed
   - **Used by**: Inngest to discover and sync your functions
   - **Add to `.env` (production only)**:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
     ```
   - **Note**: Use your actual production domain

### 4. INNGEST_EVENT_KEY (Optional)
   - **Required for**: Sending events to Inngest from external sources only
   - **Not needed**: For normal operation (already handled by Inngest client)
   - **Where to get it**: Inngest dashboard → Settings → Keys
   - **Add to `.env`** (only if sending events from outside your app):
     ```
     INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
     ```

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **AI SDK Provider Configuration**: 
   - Your `inngest/functions/generateScreens.ts` and `inngest/functions/regenerateFrame.ts` use `generateObject` and `generateText` with model strings like `"google/gemini-3-pro-preview"`.
   - These functions may need to explicitly use the OpenRouter provider. Currently, the `openrouter` import is commented out.
   - Make sure the AI SDK is configured to use OpenRouter. You might need to set up the provider in these functions.

2. **Environment Variable Format**:
   - Make sure there are **no spaces** around the `=` sign
   - Values with special characters should be in quotes
   - Example: `DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://..."`

3. **After Adding Variables**:
   - Restart your development server (`npm run dev`)
   - For production, redeploy your application

## 🔍 How to Verify

After adding the missing variables, check:
1. ✅ Build succeeds: `npm run build`
2. ✅ Development server starts: `npm run dev`
3. ✅ No 500 errors when creating projects
4. ✅ AI generation works (requires UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY)
5. ✅ Image search works in generated screens

## 🚨 Most Critical Missing Variable

**UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY** - This is required for the Unsplash image search tool that's used when generating AI screens. Without it, image search will fail silently and screens may generate without images.
